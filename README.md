# Cosmos InterChain Pact - InterChain Standards
*motto: if you thought that the InterNet was forever: see the InterChain*

## Motivation

Ethereum 2 and Polkadot-like infrastructures will implement something similar to the Cosmos InterChain idea. Ethereum 2 will arrive at it by data sharding and treating the shards as blockchains.

By having a strong top-down command structure, they will achieve fast integration of the resulting chains into a new superstructure.
For the Cosmos community to arrive at the same result (or hopefully better), tighter cooperation is needed and a recognition that chain sovereignty needs to allow for some common standards and sovereignty together. Such a community of blockchains should not allow one member to game the common resources to obtain selfish interests.

One such example: The Kava chain has used Ethermint tech to gain marketing and technological advantages while [refusing to contribute](https://www.mintscan.io/kava/proposals/101) even after repeated [calls](https://www.reddit.com/r/kava_platform/comments/xyxr1o/prevotelast_version_ethermint_funding_proposal/) from the Evmos chain for them to do so. Such a chain will be excluded from the inter-chain routing protocol until they solve their ethical issues.


## Types of Standards
1. Moral/Ethical: the Golden Rule: do not do to other chains what you would not want to be done to your chain
    1. Common Standards of Governance
    1. Chain Reputation and Accountability
    1. Public History of Chain Actions towards other chains
    1. Improved Ethical Licenses for software and research results
1. Technical
    1. IBC-related
        1. IBC Standards
    1. Execution Engine-related
        1. EVM
        1. CosmWasm
    1. State Database-related
        1. Harmonization of state API
    1. dApp-related
        1. Common cookies vocabulary
        1. Common i-frame interaction standards
1. Research
    1. Common space for collaborative research
    1. Establishing the chains that want to collaborate in each research field
    1. Standards for research contracts, sponsorship, dissemination
